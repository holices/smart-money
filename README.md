Smart Money is a project created to solve a real problem I currently have. I've always preferred minimalist interfaces, with as little information as possible, and combining the difficulty of finding something similar, with my knowledge, I decided to create my own financial management platform. Features:
- Initial page
- Modal to add inputs and outputs.
- During development, I chose to use JSON SERVER as the project API, due to its ease of configuration and application
